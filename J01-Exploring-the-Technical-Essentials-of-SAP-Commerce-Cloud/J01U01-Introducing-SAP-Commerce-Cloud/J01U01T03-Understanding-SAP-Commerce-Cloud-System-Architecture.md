  | Frontend           | It is possible to have various client and backoffice front end applications. <br>Customers can access the Online Web Store implemented by SAP Commerce Cloud Composable Storefront.<br>Customers can also access the store from a different Touchpopint like a mobile app, or any other application that uses REST AP to communicate with SAP Commerce.<br> The Backoffice framework offers different perspectives to Managers, Admins and End users, tailored to each of their usique roles.<br>SmartEdit is used to customize the Storefront.                                                                          |
  | APIs               | Several APIs are offered that can be used by other entities to get access to the underlying services or data.<br>Ex: frintend uses few of the OOTB APIs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
  | Extensions         | SAP Commerce is a modular system that follows Service Oriented Architecture.<br>It has many Out-of-the-box <em>Extensions</em><br> Each of these extensions are built for a dedicated purpose.<br>We can also implement our own extensions as per project requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
  | Platform           | Platform is the First true SAP Commerce layer. <br> It is the home for Core Persistence Framework that handles all interactions between the system and the database. We dont have to write SQL. However we must write higher level abstractions such as Flexible Search and Generic Data Objects <br> Platform also contains all kinds of services like <br> - high-level business services like Classification, Catalog, Price Calculation, etc. , <br> - infrastructure services like Authentication, User, Internationalization,etc., and <br> - low level system services like Session, Model, Tenant, Cluster, etc. |
  | Application Server | SAP Commerce comes bundled with a customized version of Apache Tomcat Application server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
  | Database layer     | All the important data is stored. <br> It is not part of the system package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
